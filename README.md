# VulDetector: A LLM-Driven C/C++ Vulnerability Detector

This is the final project of CSE 689, LLM programming. In this project, VulDetector, a LLM-driven C/C++ vulnerability detector is proposed. The system is based on a fine-tuned GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, RAG and LangChain. Our proposed system achieves a 0.90 F1-score, which can beat the state-of-art method on Big-Vul dataset.

Do not run it directly! Even if you have your own credential, it will cost you $50 per run.
